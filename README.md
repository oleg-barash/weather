# weather
I used c#, asp.net core, react js + redux 
Tools: Jetbrains Raider
There is no need to do a large amount of components in this application. Thus, i just wrote one provider for open weather api and dummy react application which just show us data.
It would be better to write some logging logic and exceptions handling.
